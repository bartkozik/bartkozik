👋 Hi, I’m Bartosz

I'm a frontend developer who loves building **well-structured, interactive UIs**. I’ve worked on commercial projects across domains like **time tracking**, **NFT marketplaces**, **AI-generated ad creatives**, and **nonprofit matchmaking platforms**.

Currently focusing on **React + TypeScript** apps with rich form logic, strong validation, and clean component architectures.

---

### 💼 What I build

- 🧩 Dynamic forms with nested logic, conditionals & schema validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
- 🏢 Custom dashboards & admin panels for organizations, banks & nonprofits
- 🔐 Wallet-based login systems (Web3 / wagmi / RainbowKit)
- 🎨 Template-driven ad creation tools integrated with AI engines
- 📊 Prototypes for presales – UI experiments & tech stack comparisons
