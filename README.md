👋 Hi, I’m Bartosz

I'm a frontend developer who loves building **well-structured, interactive UIs**. I’ve worked on commercial projects across domains like **time tracking**, **NFT marketplaces**, **AI-generated ad creatives**, and **nonprofit matchmaking platforms**.

Currently focusing on **React + TypeScript** apps with rich form logic, strong validation, and clean component architectures.

---

### 💼 What I build

- 🧩 Dynamic forms with nested logic, conditionals & schema validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
- 🏢 Custom dashboards & admin panels for organizations, banks & nonprofits
- 🔐 Wallet-based login systems (Web3 / wagmi / RainbowKit)
- 🎨 Template-driven ad creation tools integrated with AI engines
- 📊 Prototypes for presales – UI experiments & tech stack comparisons

### 📂 Key Projects (NDA & public)

💼 **Presales UI Prototype (Accounting SaaS)**  
Built one of three stack prototypes (React + Mantine + Vite) with dashboards, forms, charts. Helped guide tech stack decisions.

👥 **Nonprofit-Tech Matchmaking Platform**  
Developed multi-step forms and organization admin views (React + MobX + Zod). Strong client collaboration and logic-heavy forms.

🎨 **AI-Powered Ad Template Engine**  
Led development of dynamic, multilingual ad templates rendered in a visual canvas (React + opentype.js + pixelmatch).

🖼️ **Art Marketplace – Banking Module**  
Implemented KYC flow, secure document handling, and transaction dashboards for internal banking use (React + Mantine).

⏱️ **Time Tracking Platform**  
Sole frontend dev for 6 months. Built full UI, architecture, animations, forms, and i18n (React + MobX + Zod + Playwright).

🔗 **NFT Marketplace**  
Created Web3 login (wagmi + RainbowKit) and portfolio dashboard. Worked with brutalist UI and minimal design specs.

🌐 **Time tracking App Landing Page (Public)**  
Developed animated landing with custom scroll logic and responsive layout from scratch (Next.js 14 + SCSS + Framer Motion).  
Proposed and implemented the entire responsive layout, as mobile views were not included in the original design.
